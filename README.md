# Health Insurance Claim System
## Overview
Planned to design a real world health insurance claims database which involves information pertaining to the members, providers, claims, address, claim status, claim payment and coverage, and generated our own dataset which had 7 tables (described in the further sections). We formulated a relational database using MySQL Workbench and populated all 7 tables with approximately 100 rows each table.

## Project Goal
main goal is to extract reports for the healthcare insurance officials which can enable them to analyse and present insights to the mangeorial officials, and to understand the entire Database Design process from scratch resulting into a development of a real world database and data visualization system for the health insurance companies.
